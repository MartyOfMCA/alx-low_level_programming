This project contains source code files on static libararies in C. This project is created as part of my course reqiurements at ALX.

## Task 0
The ar command is used to create an archive file. This file would store all the object files we would need to compile our main.c source code file.

## Task 1
The script create_static_lib.sh has the ar command that creates a static library called liball.a. The command used creates a static library called liball.a for all the object files obtained after compiling to the assembly level using the -c option for the gcc command
