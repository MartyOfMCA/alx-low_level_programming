# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
This directory contains C source code files and text files containing the space complexity for various searching algorithms. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Space Complexity
* Auxiliary space
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

## How to run
All source code files can be compiled using `gcc source_file.c -o program` to produce an executable (in this case named `program`). The generated executable can be executed using the syntax:

`./program`
