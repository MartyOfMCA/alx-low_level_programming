# 0x1A. C - Hash tables
This directory contains source code file on Hash tables in C. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* Hash Table (table)
* Hash Function

## How to run
It is well noting that alll source code files in this directory are betty compliant. You can run `betty source_code_file` to check the contents in a source code file. You can easily get your development environment up and running with betty from [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/tree/master)

To compile source code file, kindly use the following flags with `gcc`:
`gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89` followed by the source code file and any other flags need

Compiled programs can then be executed in environments like the shell by easily running them as an executable: `.\program`
